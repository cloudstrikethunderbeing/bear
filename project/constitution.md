# BEAR SNS Constitution

## Preamble
The BEAR SNS exists to decentralize governance and funding for the BEAR Impact Ledger, a mission-driven ecosystem for real-world asset (RWA) projects. This constitution establishes the guiding principles, governance safeguards, and community commitments that ensure fairness, transparency, and resilience.

---

## 1. Governance Guardrails

- **Supermajorities:** Any change to treasury spending rules, tokenomics, or critical parameters must be approved by at least **66% of total voting power**.  
- **Quorum:** Treasury-related proposals require a minimum of **25–33% participation** of total voting power to pass.  
- **Cooldowns:** The same topic (e.g., treasury spend, tokenomics adjustment) may not be proposed and executed in back-to-back voting periods; a cooldown must elapse.

---

## 2. Rewards & Airdrops

- **Eligibility:** Only BEAR holders are eligible for rewards and airdrops.  
- **Claim Canister:** The DAO will operate a claim mechanism that:
  - Snapshots pre-SNS BEAR balances.
  - Issues vested neurons as follows:
    - **1:1 BEAR airdrop** for the first $100,000 ICP contributed.
    - **2:1 BEAR airdrop** for ICP contributed beyond that.  
- **Weighting:** Rewards and RWA revenue shares are weighted by **neuron dissolve delay and age**, incentivizing long-term commitment.  
- **Sybil Resistance:** Claims may be rate-limited per Internet Identity and/or require minimal stake or timed release to prevent abuse.

---

## 3. Liquidity Policy

- **Seeding:** The DAO may seed liquidity pools (e.g., ICPSwap) using treasury assets.  
- **Incentives:** LP providers may be rewarded in BEAR tokens.  
- **Progressive Deployment:** Liquidity will be added in tranches, not all at once, to discourage opportunistic dumping.

---

## 4. Treasury Policy

- **Revenue Distribution:** RWA project revenues are directed back to the DAO and distributed to BEAR holders on a regular cadence (e.g., quarterly).  
- **Form of Distribution:** Revenues may be distributed as BEAR tokens, or in ICP proportionate to ICP contributions during the decentralization sale.  
- **Alignment:** Grants and bounties are to be paid in **vested BEAR neurons** to align contributors with long-term governance.

---

## 5. Emergency Brakes

- **Pause High-Risk Topics:**  
  - A motion may be introduced to pause treasury drains, token supply changes, or other high-risk actions.  
  - Passing requires a **supermajority (≥66%) and higher quorum** than ordinary motions.  
  - While active, only limited proposals may be considered until the pause is lifted.

---

## 6. Amendment Process

- This constitution may be amended by SNS proposal, subject to the same guardrails defined herein (supermajority, quorum, cooldown).  
- Amendments must include clear rationale and a summary of community discussion.

---

## Ratification

By approving this constitution as Proposal #1, BEAR SNS establishes these principles as the foundation of its decentralized governance.
