# üêª BEAR SNS Launch ‚Äì Developer Setup Guide (VS Code)

This repo/setup will walk you through creating and submitting a Service Nervous System (SNS) launch proposal for the BEAR token.

We are using:
‚Ä¢ SNS (to decentralize governance + raise ~$100k in ICP)
‚Ä¢ NNS (to approve and spawn the SNS canisters)
‚Ä¢ Your Principal ID ‚Üí pkt5m-vzera-uztne-or4se-vgejr-xajuz-ulw55-zdxon-3euz7-gvakp-5qe
‚Ä¢ Target raise: ~5,000 ICP (‚âà $100k at $20/ICP)
‚Ä¢ Use case: Fund RWA-backed projects + profit-share via BEAR buybacks

‚∏ª

## Revenue Sharing & Buyback Model

- Contributors to the SNS Launchpad receive BEAR tokens proportional to their ICP contribution during the community sale (swap).
- 10% of all profits from RWA (Real World Asset) projects are used to buy back BEAR tokens from the market, benefiting all holders.
- All ICP raised (e.g., $100,000+) is used to fund RWA projects and DAO operations.

1. Prerequisites

Make sure you (or your dev) install:

# Install dfx and quill if not yet installed
sh -ci "$(curl -fsSL https://internetcomputer.org/install.sh)"

dfx --version
quill --version

‚Ä¢ You‚Äôll also need:
  ‚Ä¢ An NNS neuron (on your Plug/NNS wallet) with voting power (this is used to submit the proposal).
  ‚Ä¢ Your principal and account IDs (already noted above).

2. Create sns_init.json

In your VS Code project root:

touch sns_init.json

Paste the following JSON into sns_init.json:

```json

  "dapp_canisters": [],
  "fallback_controller_principal_ids": [

}
```

üëâ Notes:
‚Ä¢ max_icp_e8s = 500000000000 = 5,000 ICP hard cap (‚âà $100k target).
‚Ä¢ developer_neurons ‚Üí locks BEAR for you with a 1-year vesting.
‚Ä¢ treasury_distribution ‚Üí DAO treasury BEAR pool.
‚Ä¢ swap_distribution ‚Üí portion sold in the SNS community sale (proportional to ICP contributed).
‚Ä¢ airdrop_distribution ‚Üí rewards early BEAR community (you can add more members here).

3. Generate Proposal with Quill

Open your terminal in VS Code:

# Replace with your actual neuron ID (NNS neuron, not principal)
export NEURON_ID=<YOUR_NNS_NEURON_ID>

# Generate proposal message
quill sns make-proposal \
  --canister-ids-file sns_init.json \
  $NEURON_ID > message.json

‚∏ª

4. Submit Proposal

quill send message.json

If valid, you‚Äôll see a response with a Proposal ID.
Your SNS proposal will then show up on the NNS Dashboard for community voting.

‚∏ª

5. After Approval
‚Ä¢ SNS canisters (governance, ledger, root, swap, index) are created.
‚Ä¢ Sale begins per your swap_parameters.
‚Ä¢ Community can participate using ICP or ckUSDC (if integrated).
‚Ä¢ After success: funds ‚Üí BEAR treasury, developers get neurons, BEAR ledger is live.
‚Ä¢ 10% of RWA project profits are used for BEAR buybacks, benefiting all holders.

‚∏ª

üìå Next Steps / To-Dos
‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Confirm your NNS neuron ID (needed for step 3).
‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Decide if you want multisig fallback controllers (add other principals to fallback_controller_principal_ids).
‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Add your OpenChat community members to airdrop_distribution.
‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Adjust max_icp_e8s to reflect current ICP price ($100k target).
